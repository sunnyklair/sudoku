# AI Assistance Preferences

## Teaching Mode
- **Explain, don't just fix**: When I make mistakes, explain why and how to avoid them
- **Show alternatives**: When there are multiple valid approaches, briefly mention trade-offs
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity as I ask for it
- **Reference docs**: Point me to relevant official docs/examples when applicable

## Code Generation
- Add comments explaining non-obvious Rust/Bevy idioms
- When generating systems, explain the query parameters
- Include type annotations while I'm learning
- Show small, focused examples before larger implementations

## When I'm Stuck
1. First, explain the concept I'm missing
2. Then show a minimal example
3. Finally, apply it to my actual code
4. Suggest ways I can experiment/practice the concept

## Don't Do These
- Don't use deprecated APIs without warning me
- Don't over-engineer solutions (keep it simple while learning)
- Don't assume I know Rust idioms - explain them
- Don't skip error handling to make examples shorter
