# Game Development Concepts

## Explain Game Dev Patterns
When implementing features, explain the underlying game dev concepts:
- **Game loops**: Update vs FixedUpdate, frame-rate independence
- **Delta time**: Why multiply by `time.delta_secs()`
- **State machines**: For player states, enemy AI, game states
- **Collision detection**: AABB, spatial partitioning basics
- **Entity pooling**: When and why to reuse entities

## Architecture Guidance
- Suggest plugin-based architecture for modularity
- Show how to organize code into logical plugins (player, enemies, ui, etc.)
- Explain separation between game logic and presentation

## Learning Milestones & Progression

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Current)
- Basic Bevy app structure
- Spawning entities and components
- Simple systems and queries
- Basic input handling
- 2D rendering basics

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics
- State management
- Collision detection
- Asset loading (sprites, sounds)
- UI basics with bevy_ui
- Game states (menu, playing, paused)

### Phase 3: Polish
- Animations and tweening
- Particle effects
- Sound and music
- Scene management
- Save/load systems

### Phase 4: Advanced
- Networking basics
- ECS optimization
- Custom rendering
- Advanced AI patterns
- Procedural generation
